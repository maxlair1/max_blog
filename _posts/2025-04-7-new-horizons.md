# New Horizons

Good afternoon (or morning, or evening, wherever you are!), I am excited to kick off my new simple format blog. This is a very minimal blog formated [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and published using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

I plan to publish all sorts of stuff about myself, my projects, adventures, and things I'm currently learning. Feel free to read more about me [here](/about).

Happy creating!
