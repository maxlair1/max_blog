# New Horizons

Good afternoon (or morning, or evening, wherever you are!), I am excited to kick off my new simple format blog. This is a very minimal blog formated in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and published using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

I plan to publish all sorts of stuff about myself, my projects, adventures, and things I'm currently learning. Feel free to read more about me [here](/me).

## Project Plans
I have developed a keen interest in Linux, particularly [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) (i use arch btw), and I have set off on a journey to install arch onto my 2017 MacBook Pro (13"), which is a notoriously bad model both in hardware (why on earth did you put the `esc` key there???) and software, especially with installing any Linux distro. It has been a crazy challenge so far. As of yesterday (4/6/2025) I have officially booted into Arch on it! Crazy milestone. I want to refine the install process, and begin [ricing](https://excaliburzero.gitbooks.io/an-introduction-to-linux-ricing/content/ricing.html). More on this later! 

My planned dotfiles are:
|Purpose|Selection|
|-------|---------|
|OS | Arch Linux|
|WM | [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland), [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/)|
|Terminal | [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)|
|Fetch|[Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch), or [pfetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pfetch)|
|Bar|[Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar)|

And whatever else I feel like adding!

That's it for now.
Happy creating!
